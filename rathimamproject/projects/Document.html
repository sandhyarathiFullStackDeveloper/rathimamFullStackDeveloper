        FLOWERS

    <h2>rose</h2>
    <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae
        (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
        cultivars.[5]They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are
        often armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in
        colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers
        native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[6] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown
        for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose
        plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[6]
        Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

    <h2>lotus</h2>
    <p>
        Nelumbo nucifera, also known as sacred lotus, Indian lotus,[1] or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of
        aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. It is sometimes colloquially called a water lily, though this more
        often refers to members of the family Nymphaeaceae.[2]

        Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop
        hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately and most are
        eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in
        and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds
        rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.
